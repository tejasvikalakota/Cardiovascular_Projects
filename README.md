In this project I worked with a publicly avalible cardiovascular disease data(CDD) set(CDD.xlsx) from kaggle that consists of patient records from hosptials across the United States. Utilzing the data set, I cleaned over 70,000+ patient records in order to run a logistic regression algorithim(cdd.py) that allows users to predict the likeolhood of a cardiovascular disease given a body mass index value. Furthermore, I wrote code that outputs a file showcasing likehoods of adverse CDD events based on a range of BMI values. Alongside this I developed a custom library(custom_lib.py) that helps provide basic statstics about the patients age and Blood pressure values in the data set.
